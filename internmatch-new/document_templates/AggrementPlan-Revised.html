        <br />
        <li> The internship will take place in a suitably located, accessible and suitable workplace. Home office locations do not meet

        may report their concerns by contacting Outcome.Life. The company can request that the internship be terminated
        or alternatively the company may choose to counsel the intern to rectify the issue. </li>
        <br />
        <li> The intern agrees to dress appropriately to work and meet the other standards that the Host Company sets for its employees. </li>

        <br />
        <li> The Host Company confirms that it complies with applicable laws in the conduct of its business, including those related to
        OH&S and use and operation of its premises. </li>
        <br />
        <li> All WIL Students provided by Outcome.Life are comprehensively covered by the Outcome.Life Voluntary Workers insurance for
