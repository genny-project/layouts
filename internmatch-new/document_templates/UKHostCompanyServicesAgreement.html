      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="bold-text">InternMatch UK Limited</span> (company number 13308420) with registered address 64 New Cavendish Street, London W1G 8TB, United Kingdom <span>(“InternMatch International)</span></p>

  <div>
    <p class="bold-text">BACKGROUND</p>
    <div class="description">
      <p>InternMatch sources host companies who wish to host at least one intern within their organisation, so the intern can complete an internship <span class="bold">(“Internship Placement”)</span> as part of a formal education program that the Intern is enrolled in or a work experience placement <span class="bold">(“Vocational Placement”)</span>.</p>
      <p>The Host Company has agreed to sign up onto InternMatch’s online intern matching platform <span class="bold">(“InternMatch Platform”)</span> and host at least one intern within its organisation on the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
      <p>Each intern placed with the Host Company (an <span class="bold">“Intern”</span>) will also enter into an agreement with both the Host Company and InternMatch <span class="bold">(“Internship Placement Agreement”)</span> which can be accessed via the InternMatch Platform upon confirmation of a specific Internship Placement.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="blank-div"></div>

  <div class="description">
    <div class="grid cols-2">
      <div>
        <p class="bold-text">THE PARTIES AGREE THAT:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="bold-text">1. Term</p>
        <p>This Agreement commences on the date which the second party has signed and dated this Agreement, until the Agreement is terminated by either party by written notice.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="bold-text">2. Nature of the Internship Placement</p>
        <p>The Internship Placement is a Vocational Placement.</p>
        <p>The Host Company is under no obligation to provide the Intern with any remuneration during the term of, or in respect of any work performed by the Intern during, the Internship Placement.</p>
        <p>The Host Company, may if it wishes, pay the Intern during the Internship Placement. All payments must be made in accordance with all applicable laws. If the Host Company decides to pay the Intern, the Host Company must inform InternMatch of the amount that is to be paid to the Intern prior to the payment to the Intern.</p>
        <p>Interns are approved to only complete an Internship Placement with the Host Company or commonly controlled entities. Interns are not allowed to undertake an Internship Placement, employment or an unremunerated Internship Placement with a third party.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="bold-text">3. Internship Placement extension</p>
        <p>Under no circumstances is the Internship Placement to be extended beyond the specified start and end dates as indicated in the Internship Placement Agreement.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="bold-text">4. Commitment to training</p>
        <p>Host Companies and Interns must maintain the agreed training plan developed prior to the commencement of the Internship Placement. The training plan identifies the types of duties the Intern will be introduced to and, as such, is a practical base that will ensure the Intern obtains relevant learning opportunities, while also ensuring that the Intern develops skills and knowledge that are relevant to the Host Company’s business.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="bold-text">5. Supervision</p>
        <p>The Host Company must provide adequate supervision to the Intern throughout the Internship Placement, whether the Intern is on-site or interning remotely, including:</p>
        <p>a) consistently monitoring the Intern's learning progress;</p>
        <p>b) appointing an adequately qualified staff member to the supervisor role;</p>
        <p>c) providing training as required;</p>
        <p>d) ensuring appropriate procedures and processes are in place that support a positive learning environment for the Intern;</p>
        <p>e) promptly communicating any changes to the Internship Placement to InternMatch;</p>
        <p>f) ensuring that the Host Company has a demonstrated commitment to a workplace that is free from bullying and discrimination including providing copies of any policies relating to equal opportunities and anti-bullying, and immediately reporting to InternMatch any complaint or incident involving the Intern in respect of bullying or discrimination in the workplace;</p>
        <p>g) providing an induction program, to ensure that the Intern is aware of, and familiar with, the obligations of safe work, policies and procedures that apply to the Host Company's business and operations, including the procedure for notifying health and safety issues at the Host Company;</p>
        <p>h) ensuring, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the Intern is not exposed to risks to their health and safety arising from the conduct of the Internship Placement; and</p> 
        <p>i) completing in a timely manner the Intern evaluations that InternMatch, or associated parties, will request periodically throughout the Internship Placement.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the avoidance of doubt, InternMatch is not responsible for supervising the Intern during their placement.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="bold-text">6. Other obligations</p>
        <p>InternMatch appreciates the time involved in training and supporting the Interns. The Host Company must notify InternMatch immediately if any of the following circumstances change in relation to any Intern:</p>
        <p>a) hours of work;</p>
        <p>b) attendance issues (i.e. sick days, punctuality issues, or other);</p>
        <p>c) changes to the scope or objectives of the Internship Placement;</p>
        <p>d) human resources issues that may affect the Internship Placement or supervision of the Intern. For example, the departure of the Intern's immediate supervisor; and</p>
        <p>e) any changes in respect of any payments to the Interns.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>      
        <p>The Host Company confirms that for the duration of the Internship Placement, it shall maintain personal injury and other insurance for the benefit of the Intern, such insurances being on terms substantially similar to the insurance provided by the Host Company for the benefit of its employees.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="bold-text">7. Induction Program</p>
        <p>In addition to any induction programs conducted by the Host Company, InternMatch will provide an induction program for the Intern, informing them of their general responsibility to behave in a safe manner in a workplace environment and comply with the requirements of occupational health and safety legislation.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="bold-text">8. Consent to use company information on the InternMatch Platform</p>
        <p>Unless the Host Company has notified InternMatch to the contrary, the Host Company consents to its name, logo and other relevant information required to facilitate the Internship Placement being uploaded onto the InternMatch Platform.</p>
        <p>The Host Company consents to InternMatch promoting Internship Placement opportunities available with the Host Company, including on the InternMatch Platform.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="bold-text">9. Guidelines for Interns and Host Companies</p>
        <p>InternMatch may publish guidelines from time to time and provide these to the Host Company to assist with the Internship Placement.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="bold-text">10. Acknowledgement</p>
        <p>InternMatch provides an internship placement service and will use its best endeavours to place a suitable Intern with a Host Company. InternMatch is not responsible for the acts or omissions of an Intern while they are on a placement with the Host Company.</p>
        <p>During the Internship Placement, the Intern is under the control and direction of the Host Company.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="bold-text">11. Early cessation of the Internship Placement</p>
        <p>The Host Company reserves the right to cease hosting the Intern prior to the end date of the Internship Placement in circumstances where it reasonably believes there to be a legitimate reason for such cessation. The Host Company agrees to advise InternMatch, prior to any decision to cease hosting the Intern, of the reasons why it wishes to cease the Internship Placement and to only cease hosting the Intern if the issue cannot be resolved within 10 business days. As this is a training opportunity, any issues (including poor performance or attitude of the Intern) are required to be identified and discussed with InternMatch so that the Intern is given an opportunity to improve.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="bold-text">12. Costs and Post-Internship Employment</p>
        <p>a) There is no obligatory cost to the Host Company for taking on an Intern during the Internship Placement.</p>
        <p>b) To incentivise InternMatch to provide the highest quality interns that could result in the Host Company offering the Intern employment after the Internship Placement, the Host Company agrees to pay InternMatch a Post Internship Employment Fee (as defined below) if the Host Company offers ongoing employment to the Intern at the end of, or during, the Internship Placement.</p>
        <p>c) The Host Company agrees to pay InternMatch a fee of £3,000 plus VAT if applicable (the <span class="bold">“Post Internship Employment Fee”</span>) if, during the period of the Internship Placement or six months after the internship has ended, the Host Company employs the Intern for at least 15 hours per week. The Post Internship Employment Fee is payable within 14 days of the Intern commencing employment with the Host Company.</p>
        <p>d) The Host Company agrees to pay InternMatch a fee of £3,000 plus VAT if applicable (the <span class="bold">“Employment Referral Fee”</span>) if, InternMatch introduces a potential Intern or employee to the Host Company (who has not completed an Internship with the Host Company), and during the six months after the introduction the Host Company employs the potential Intern or employee for at least 15 hours per week. The Employment Referral Fee is payable within 14 days of the potential Intern or employee commencing employment with the Host Company.</p>
