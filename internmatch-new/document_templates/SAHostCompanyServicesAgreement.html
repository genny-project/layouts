        </p>
        <p class="bold">1.1 Nature of the Internship Placement</p>
        <p>The Internship Placement is unpaid. The Internship Placement is a Vocational Placement and as such, the
          Intern has no entitlement to any remuneration in respect of the Internship Placement or work undertaken during
          the Internship Placement. The Host Company is under no obligation to provide the Intern with any remuneration
          during the term of, or in respect of any work performed by the Intern during the Internship Placement.</p>

        <p>Host Companies and Interns must maintain the agreed Training Plan developed prior to the commencement of the
          Internship Placement. The Training Plan identifies the types of duties the Intern will be introduced to and as

          ensuring that they develop skills and knowledge that are relevant to your business.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="bold">1.4 Supervision&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Host Companies must provide adequate supervision to the Intern throughout the Internship Placement. These
          obligations must be met whether the intern is on-site or interning remotely. This involves:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>consistently monitoring your Intern's learning progress&nbsp;</li>
          <li>appointing an adequately qualified staff member to the supervisor role&nbsp;</li>
          <li>providing training as required&nbsp;</li>
          <li>ensuring appropriate procedures and processes are in place that support a positive learning environment
            for the Intern&nbsp;</li>
          <li>communicating any changes or circumstances of the Internship Placement to Outcome.Life immediately</li>
          <li>ensuring that the Host Company has a demonstrated commitment to a workplace that is free from bullying and
            discrimination, and immediately reporting to Outcome.Life any complaint or incident involving the Intern in
            respect of bullying or discrimination in the workplace&nbsp;</li>
          <li>providing an induction program, to ensure that the Intern is aware of and familiar with the obligations of
            safe work, policies and procedures that apply to the Host Company's business and operations, including the
            procedure for notifying health and safety issues at the Host Company; and</li>
          <li>ensuring, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the Intern is not exposed to risks to their health and
            safety arising from the conduct of the undertaking of the Host Company</li>
          <li>completing in a timely manner the intern evaluations that Outcome.Life, or associated parties, will
            request periodically throughout the internship</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="bold">1.5 Other obligations</p>
        <p>Outcome.Life appreciates the time involved in training and supporting the Interns. The Host Company must
          notify Outcome.Life immediately if any of the following circumstances change:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>hours of work&nbsp;</li>
          <li>attendance issues (i.e. sick days, punctuality issues, or other)&nbsp;</li>
          <li>changes to the Training Plan (i.e. changes to the scope or objectives of the Internship Placement)&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>human resources issues that may affect the Internship Placement or supervision of the Intern. For example,
            the departure of the Intern's immediate supervisor.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>any other changes</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="bold">1.6 Obligations of Outcome.Life</p>
        <p>Outcome.Life acknowledges that it must:&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>provide an induction program, for the Intern who will undertake the Internship Placement, informing them
            of their general responsibility to behave in a safe manner in a workplace environment and comply with the
            requirements of occupational health and safety legislation; and&nbsp;</li>
          <li>remain responsible for the overall control and discipline of the Intern, apart from reasonable direction
            provided on a day to day basis by the Host Company to the Intern while they are undertaking the Internship
            Placement at the Host Company's premises.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="bold">1.7 Consent to use company information in marketing material</p>
        <p>The Host Company authorises Outcome.Life to use their company logo, name and other information relevant to
          the Internship Placements on the Outcome.Life and InternMatch websites and in other marketing material
          distributed by Outcome.Life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Outcome.Life will check with the Host Company and the Intern on the progress and attendance of the Intern on
          a regular basis. Any required leave must be agreed to by Outcome.Life in advance. Any absence due to sickness
          must be reported to the Placement Consultant and Supervisor at the Host Company immediately.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="bold">2.2 Dress code</p>
        <p>The Intern must conform to the dress code of the Host Company.</p>
        <p class="bold">2.3 Confidentiality&nbsp;</p>

        <p>All intellectual property in all materials created by the Intern or Host Company during the Internship
          Placement will be and remain the property of the Host Company.</p>
        <p class="bold">2.5 Misuse of Host Company facilities and property&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Any misuse of Host Company facilities or property is prohibited, and the Intern shall be liable for any
          expenses incurred as a result of such misuse. It is the responsibility of the Intern to ensure that they
          understand Host Company policy regarding the use of mobile phones, Internet access and phone usage for
          personal use during Internship Placement hours. The Intern must conform to these policies.</p>
        <p class="bold">2.6 Conduct&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Intern agrees to carry out all assigned tasks and to approach every opportunity provided by the Host
          Company with enthusiasm and professionalism to the best of their ability.</p>
        <p class="ebold">2.7 Issues&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the first instance, issues that arise should be discussed with the supervisor at the Host Company. If the
          issue is not resolved, Outcome.Life will make every effort possible to facilitate and discuss the matter with
          the Intern and Host Company.</p>
        <p class="bold">2.8 Liability</p>
        <p>Outcome.Life provides an internship placement service and will use its best endeavours to place a suitable
          Intern with a Host Company, however, Outcome. Life is not responsible for the acts or omissions of an Intern
          while they are on a placement with the Host Company.</p>
        <p>The Host Company acknowledges and agrees that the Intern is not an employee or agent of Outcome.Life.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p class="bold">2.9 Early cessation of the Internship Placement&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Host Company reserves the right to cease hosting the Intern prior to the End Date of the Internship
          Placement in circumstances where it reasonably believes there to be a legitimate reason for such cessation.
          The Host Company agrees to advise Outcome.Life, prior to any decision to cease hosting the Intern, of the
          reasons why it wishes to cease the Internship Placement and to only cease hosting the Intern if the issue
          cannot be resolved. As this is a training opportunity, any issues whether poor performance or attitude are
          required to be identified and discussed with Outcome.Life so that the Intern is given an opportunity to
          improve.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="subtitile-description">

        </p>
        <p>3.1 There is no cost to the Host Company for taking on an Intern.</p>
        <p>3.2 To incentivise Outcome.Life to provide the highest quality interns that could result in the Host Company
          offering the Intern employment after the internship, the Host Company agrees to pay Outcome.Life a Post
          Internship Employment Fee.</p>
        <p>3.3 The Host Company agrees to pay Outcome.Life $1,500 plus GST (being the &ldquo;Post Internship Employment
          Fee&rdquo;) if, during the period of six months after the internship has ended, the Host Company employs the
          intern for at least 15 hours per week.</p>
        <p>3.4 It should be noted that there is no expectation for the Host Company to offer employment to an Intern
          after their internship has been completed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The parties acknowledge that:</span></p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Internship placements (workplace-based training or special program placements) are designed to assist
            Interns to provide a cultural/social experience and/or to develop skills relevant to their tertiary
            education, current occupation or field of study. It will involve the observation of tasks performed by
            employees of the Host Company and/or the performance of tasks under close supervision of the employees of
            the Host Company.&nbsp;</span></li>
          <li>There is no intention on the part of the Host Company or the Intern to create an employment relationship

            becomes an employee&nbsp;</span></li>
          <li>The Host Company understands that workplace relations laws make it unlawful to employ an employee and not
            pay them, and that penalties may be imposed against any employer who breaches these laws.&nbsp;</span></li>

            </span><em>Fair Work Act 2009</span></em> (Cth)</span></li>
