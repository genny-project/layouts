                From commencement, the Internship programs are unpaid and considered and defined to be vocational placements under the Fair
                Work Act 2009 (Cth). Although Interns may participate in the performance of productive activities during
                Internship Placements, there remains no entitlement to, and will not receive, any remuneration in respect
                of the Internship Placement or work undertaken during the Internship Placement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Internship Placements do not represent an intention to, and do not, create an employment relationship of any kind and accordingly,
                Interns will not (for any purpose) become an employee of the Host Company during the period of an Internship
                Placement.

                The Internship Placement is unpaid. The Internship Placement is a Vocational Placement and as such, the Intern has no entitlement
                to any remuneration in respect of the Internship Placement or work undertaken during the Internship Placement.

            <p>
                Host Companies and Interns must maintain the agreed Training Plan developed prior to the commencement of the Internship Placement.
                The Training Plan identifies the types of duties the Intern will be introduced to and as such, is a practical
                base that will ensure the Intern obtains relevant learning opportunities, while also ensuring that they develop
                skills and knowledge that are relevant to your business.

                the Education Provider the student is enrolled with or Outcome.Life. Medical / travel insurance is the sole

                ensure that valid and appropriate cover is in place.

                The Host Company reserves the right to cease hosting the Intern prior to the End Date of the Internship Placement in circumstances
                where it reasonably believes there to be a legitimate reason for such cessation. The Host Company agrees
                to advise Outcome.Life, prior to any decision to cease hosting the Intern, of the reasons why it wishes to
                cease the Internship Placement and to only cease hosting the Intern if the issue cannot be resolved. As this
                is a training opportunity, any issues whether poor performance or attitude are required to be identified
                and discussed with Outcome.Life so that the Intern is given an opportunity to improve.
