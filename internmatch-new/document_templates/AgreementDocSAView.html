      <ul style="padding-left: 15px;">
        <li> The purpose of this agreement is to ensure a productive and successful internship experience for all parties. </li>

        <li> The internship is an opportunity for the Work Integrated Learning (WIL) students <span class="bold">(“Interns”)</span> to gain practical work experience with the host company (place where internship is conducted). </li>
        <br />
        <li> The internship and this agreement does not constitute an employment agreement or any offer of employment. The host company must not charge any fees or expenses to the Intern to undertake the Internship. </li>
        <br />
        <li> The internship will commence and end on the dates agreed between the host company, the Intern and InternMatch and is provided in the schedule below. </li>

        <br />
        <li> The host company will assign an appropriate supervisor to mentor the Intern.

        <br />
        <li> Upon completion of the internship, the host company may provide a LinkedIn endorsement outlining tasks and competencies of the Intern. </li>
        <br />
        <li> Should the host company consider an Intern is in breach of attendance, performance, or any other company policy, they may report their concerns by contacting InternMatch. The host company can request that the internship be terminated or alternatively choose to counsel the Intern to rectify the issue. </li>
        <br />

        <li> The Intern agrees to keep all information and documents entrusted to them confidential and in accordance with host company procedures and ethics. If an Intern wishes to use any information gained on their internship in an assignment or course work as part of any study they are currently undertaking, the Intern must obtain the written (or by email) consent of the host company before doing so.</li>

The Intern must conform to these policies. </li>
        <br />
        <li> The Intern agrees to carry out all assigned tasks and to approach every opportunity provided by the host company with enthusiasm and professionalism to the best of their ability. </li>
        <br />
        <li> In the first instance, issues that arise should be discussed by the Intern with the supervisor at the host company. If the issue is not resolved, InternMatch will make every effort possible to facilitate and discuss the matter with the Intern and the host company.</li>
        <br />
        <li> InternMatch provides an internship placement service and will use its best endeavours to place a suitable Intern with a host company. InternMatch is not responsible for the acts or omissions of an Intern while they are on a placement with the host company.</li>

      <p>Any notice given by a party under this Agreement shall be in writing and delivered by hand, by pre-paid first-class post or by email to the following relevant address(es):</p>
      <p>
        InternMatch:  Email (only): hello@internmatch.io<br />
        Intern:             Address:  [[INTERN.PRI_ADDRESS_FULL]]  Email:  [[INTERN.PRI_EMAIL]]<br />

      <p>Neither the Intern or the host company may assign its respective rights under this agreement without the consent of InternMatch. InternMatch may at any time assign its rights under this agreement provided that it provides prior written notice to the Intern and to the host company.</p>

      <p>No failure or delay by a party to exercise any right or remedy provided under this agreement or by law shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.

      <p>This agreement and the host company placement agreement (as between InternMatch and the host company) constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes and extinguishes all previous agreements, promises, assurances, warranties, representations and understandings between them, whether written or oral, relating to its subject matter.</p>
