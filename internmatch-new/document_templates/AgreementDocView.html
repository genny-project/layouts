          <h2>General Terms and Conditions</h2>
          <div class="description">
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                The purpose of this agreement is to ensure a productive and
                successful internship experience for all parties.
              </li>
              <li>
                The internship is an opportunity for the Work Integrated
                Learning ("WIL") students to gain practical work experience with
                the Host Company (place where the internship is conducted).
              </li>
              <li>
                The internship does not constitute an Employment agreement or
                any offer of employment with the Host Company.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any financial support or transport allowances may be offered at
                the Host Company's discretion. However, a Host Company cannot
                charge any fees or expenses to the Intern for this work
                experience to take place.
              </li>

              <li>
                The Internship will commence only after an agreed commencement
                date and end date is determined by the Host Company with the
                Intern and approved by Outcome.Life (this form).
              </li>

              <li>
                The Host Company will provide a training plan clearly outlining
                the range of duties to be performed and the range of skills and
                competencies required for the WIL Student during the course of
                the internship.
              </li>

              <li>
                The Host Company will assign an appropriate Supervisor to mentor
                the WIL Student.
              </li>

              <li>
                The Supervisor will be present and available to support the
                intern with any queries for the majority of their internship
                placement. Should the assigned intern supervisor not be
                available, an appropriate qualified replacement will be
                assigned.
              </li>

              <li>
                The internship will take place in a suitably located, accessible

              <li>
                Upon Completion of the Internship Program, the Host Company may

                competencies of the intern although is not required to do so.
              </li>

              <li>
                Should the Host company consider a WIL Student is in breach of
                attendance, performance and/or any other company policy, they
                may report their concerns by contacting Outcome.Life. The
                company can request that the internship be terminated or
                alternatively the company may choose to counsel the intern to
                rectify the issue.
              </li>

              <li>
                The intern agrees to dress appropriately to work and meet the
                other standards that the Host Company sets for its employees.
